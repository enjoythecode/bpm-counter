Purpose: "Calculate" BPM from microphone by detecting sudden rises in sound loudness and registering the time between each "beat."

Useful making sure you aren't going too fast/slow.
Works best with BPM < 300, and in quiet environments. Can tolerate constant noise for the most part (e.g. fan)

Complimentary to my drumming hobby. Enjoy!
